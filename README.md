**Below is a description of my project: I created a readme file generator using node.js and the inquirer package. I prompted a list of questions and then used write file async to generate the new custom file.

**Instructions on usage: I will use this to easily generate new readme files. I will provide a video upon complition.

**Here are the steps required to install your project; the user will need to clone down the repo from github and then install inquirer and util.

**How to contribute: I have now special instructions.

**Here are some example tests I've run I tested a few different functions and failed and I ended up using promisify with write file async.
